# Flyover
Using MapKit and FlyoverKit to show flyover views of iconic places throughout the world. 

 ## What I Learned
 * How to use the [Flyover Kit Module](https://github.com/SvenTiigi/FlyoverKit)
 * Camera configuration with altitude, pitch, duration, and heading step
 * Map configuration which included map type, zoom, and compass navigation (MKMapViewDelegate)
